# ESP32 - M1

The project is focused on learning new technologies while making it a fun experience. Here, I will gather every software idea I can think of and create tools that will make it easier to develop new applications in the future. All the drivers are written in C++ and utilize the ESP-IDF framework.

This repository has been created for individuals who are struggling with ESP-IDF and need access to code examples. I hope that this will be a helpful resource for them in the future.
